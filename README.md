Multi Layer Perceptron

Multi-layer perception is also known as MLP. It is fully connected dense layers, which transform any input dimension to the desired dimension. A multi-layer perception is a neural network that has multiple layers. To create a neural network we combine neurons together so that the outputs of some neurons are inputs of other neurons.
